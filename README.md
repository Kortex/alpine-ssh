# Alpine SSH client

This project's aim is to provide a simple SSH client based on Alpine Linux. The base image use is Alpine 3.18.2 but 
various others can be configured if required.

The produced image contains an installation of ssh, bash and curl. Note also that the image runs with a non-root user.
